		<h2>Favorite description from backend</h2>
		<p>Since this version, whenever you use the "Add to Favorites" button on Project Explorer or in the ADT Editor, the description of the object is automatically fetched from the backend.</p>
		<p>In case of manual creation of favorites from the view menu, you can use Import button, found next to description field to achieve the same goal. <br/>Each time the button is pressed, system selection is provided.
