		<h1 class="heading">ABAP Favorites - Changelog version 1.0.66</h1>
		<h2>Favorite description from backend</h2>
		<p>Since this version, whenever you use the "Add to Favorites" button on Project Explorer or in the ADT Editor,
			the description of the object is automatically fetched from the backend.</p>
		<p>In case of manual creation of favorites from the view menu, you can use Import button, found next to
			description field to achieve the same goal. <br />Each time the button is pressed, system selection is
			provided. You must be logged on to the system in order to fetch the description. No installation of any
			backend component is needed. </p>
		<p>Added on a base of GH <a href="https://github.com/fidley/ABAPFavorites/issues/107">issue 107</a>.</p>

		<h2>Folder double click action</h2>
		<p>Since this version, whenever you use double-click on the folder it will be automatically expanded or
			collapsed.</p>
		<p>If in the folder creation/edit dialog you will fill the field "URL to open on double-click", instead of
			expand/collapse, the saved URL will be opened.</p>

		<h2>Folder dependency update - now it's possible to link folder with working sets</h2>
		<p>So far it was possible to choose if the folder is linked to project or not. Since this version you can also
			decide if the folder is linked to working set.</p>
		<p>To enable this, the folder creation/edit dialog was adapted. You can find there now respective radio button
			for each dependency type.</p>
		<p>Folder linked to working sets are hidden/shown exactly the same way like project dependent folders.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Double-click behavior for objects stored in the working set dependent folders has been adapted in the way,
			that popup with the projects linked to working set of folder is displayed, before the execution/opening of
			the object is done.</p>
		<p>Added on a base of GH <a href="https://github.com/fidley/ABAPFavorites/issues/97">issue 97</a>.</p>
